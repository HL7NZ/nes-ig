#### To the test environment:

Maternity and related service providers and their software vendors will be given access to the Newborn Enrolment Service (NBES) in the Health Identity Platform (HIP) Compliance environment for testing and training after completing the on-boarding process described below.

#### To the production environment:

Access to the NBES is available to Maternity and related service providers who require the ability to send newborn enrolment nominations.

### On-boarding and Implementation

2.    Once your onboarding request has been approved, you will be provided with the information to start your integration. The integration team will be in touch if further information is required.
  * You will receive your credentials in an email and a sms message to the details provided in the onboarding form.
  * You will also receive the access token url, provided scopes, and the UAT endpoint.
3. Complete your development and testing.
4. Submit the results of the compliance tests by email to the [integration team](mailto:integration@health.govt.nz).
